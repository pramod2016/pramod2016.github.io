	his template uses the ShieldUI-Lite open source Suite.
It renders a responsive grid component, which has editing capabilities.
The sample uses the ShieldUI-Lite jquery Grid component for visualization of data.
To see more examples of this type of widget, please go here.<br/>
The component supports many different types of editing, which can be used to further enhance this template. 
Easy to ahieve is cell-based editing, where only single cell is edited at a time. 
Also built in is inline-editing, which is most often used.<p> 
Batch operations and updates are also supported and allow multiple update operations. 
For more advanced scenarios, you can refer to the Restful web services samples. 
For each editing operation, validation can be used to safeguard against errors. 
Additional editors can be employed as well, such as external editors to handle custom layout requirements.<br/></p>
